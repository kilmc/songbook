        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p>
          good arms versus bad arms will win hands down down
          they are built to hold and fit, look how far they go around
          you don't need these now that you've found another pair
          and the difference is astounding, i should expect
        </p>

        <p>
          except leave the rest at arm's length
          keep your naked flesh under your favorite dress
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          when they reach out, don't touch them, don't touch them
        </p>

        <p>
          i decided this decision some six months ago
          so i'll stick to my guns, but from now on it's war
          i am armed with the past and the will and a brick
          i might not want you back, but i want to kill him
        </p>
        
        <p>
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          keep your naked flesh under your favorite dress
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          when they reach out, don't touch them, don't touch them
        </p>

        <p>
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          don't brush with him, he might have diseases
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          steer clear of the grasp, girl -- run, run, away
        </p>

        <p>
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          just roll over boy and don't make me do this
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          i am armed to the teeth and i'm heavy set
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          i'm not ready to see you this happy
          and leave the rest at arm's length
          i'm still in love with you, can't admit it yet
        </p>
